## Certs
Currently there are two scripts that perform the same basic function: check the cert for a domain name and report back any issues.

In the certs/ directory there are two scripts:
* check_cert.ps1 - PowerShell version for Windows systems
* check_cert_chain.py - Python version for Linux/MacOS systems
